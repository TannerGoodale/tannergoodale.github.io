                <h4>Salt Lake City Temple</h4>
                
                <p>The Salt Lake Temple is considered by many to be an international icon for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  It's tall spires and unique architecture help distinguish it from many of the other temples around the world.  It was the first temple to begin construction in Utah, starting in 1853, and wouldn't be completed until 1893.</p>
